# Introduction
Finding new clients/jobs on upwork can be a time consuming task, we are lazy and we would like to make a tool that picks the best jobs for us everyday.

# The tool (upworkfeed)
The idea is simple, upwork has an [rss feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) with the most recent job posts, the tool is going to read the feed and filter out the jobs we don't want and keep the jobs we want.
